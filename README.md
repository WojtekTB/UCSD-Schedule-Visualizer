# UCSD-Schedule-Visualizer
  
Extension that creates a timetable of your WebReg classes and shows you where the class you are hovering over would fit in your schedule. This uses timetable.js. It also allows you to quickly generate a google maps route of your classes.  
The code is pretty jank, but if you want to fix that make a PR :)
